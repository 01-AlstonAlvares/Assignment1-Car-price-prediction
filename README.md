## Report:

In this assignment, car prediction model was created with features like brands, owner, etc. It was understood that features influenced the price. The features that mainly influenced the price were no of owners, brand, milage, year and km driven. Preprocessing was a little tricky as it had to be done carefully. For preprcessing the things done were text features converted to numeric, extracted the brands and applied log transformation.


Linear regression algorithm was used for this assignment. Researched about few algorithms like Random Forest and gradient boosting, they were better for non linear interaction between the features, while linear regression offered a very good base and was a little tricky. I also researched about a classification algorithm k-nearest neighbors it was less suitable for regression.For the features i didnt select were seler type and transmission as these didnt have much impact to the price compared to the features mentioned above.

Understanding which features are most strongly influencing car price not only improves the models performance but also gives us insights for car buyers and sellers and also chaky company.
